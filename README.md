## Dotfiles
â˜• My neovim dots

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ’¤ Lazy loading plugins by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- ðŸš€ 40-80ms load time on my old Windows machine. (It takes 30-50ms to load so it's actually way faster.)
- ðŸ’ª Modular design for easy extendabiity.

## âš¡ Requirements
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) => 0.8.2
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [A Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) I personally use [Fisa Code](https://github.com/sainnhe/icursive-nerd-font/tree/master/dist/Fisa%20Code)
- A terminal emulator.

## ðŸ“¦ Installing
cd to ~/.config/nvim on Linux or AppData/Local/nvim on Windows
Copy paste this into your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/isynquwu/dotfiles.git
```
Then start Neovim by using this command
```
nvim
```
Then it'll automaticlly clone lazy.nvim (it might take a while) and then install the plugins.
The default colorscheme is the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim).
